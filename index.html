        <aside><small>&#10023;I am assuming you have already developed your research question, if you are struggling with that, checkout "Tips!"&#10023;</small></aside>
        <p>
        Take a good look at your research question and pick out the words that are most important to the main idea -- these will be your keywords. Then go ahead and pick your first Database!
        You can either let your heart guide you to a good one or or you can take my advice in "Tips!" Now get familiar with the database you chose. Read its guide, as most databases have a 
        controlled vocabulary, which you should utilize to help you determine some more important words to add in your string. Subject/controlled vocabulary searching is a more powerful 
        and precise way to search, so don't overlook it. You can also note the subject headings of papers you find useful as you go for the same reason!
        Make sure to check the databases' guide for its conventions regarding advanced searching features. Using your knowledge of the databases' syntax preferences you can 
        string together your keywords & useful subject headings, controlled vocabulary entries, etc, using quotation marks, parentheses, and the Boolean search terms AND, OR, & NOT (see "Methods"" below). 
        <br>
        <b> Be prepared to repeat this process! Trial and error is an important part of finding your search strategy.</b>

                <summary>Methods</summary>
                Most people are familiar with the everyday “googling.” 
                There’s no special formula for this kind of search, just open up your browser & ask a question in the same
                format you might ask any other question. For many people this method is “good enough” for their causal 
                everyday questions, but there are far more efficient methods. 
          <br>
          <br>
                Citation searching is exactly what it sounds like -- it is done by conducting research either 
                through the references in whatever article you are reading, or by looking for other articles that cite the source. 
                This method can be great if you've already found an amazing source and you want closely related information, but it is important to consider 
                the downsides of this method, one being that it might lead you backwards into older less-relevant research.
          <br>
          <br>
        When you're doing research your search strategies probably won't be comprised of just one method, but if you were to rely on just one it ought to be
        the "Building Blocks" method. With this method you start with your research question and then you cut it down to the keywords. Once you've got
        your keywords, you list any alternate terms they might have. These are the building blocks you've brought to the table, and to put it
        reductively, your goal with this method is to make these terms into the longest, scariest search-string you can think of (it's not scary, I promise!).
        To complete this mission, you will need to combine your terms using Boolean search-terms/operators. The search terms are AND, OR, & NOT. Sound familar?
        Well, your computer is familar with them too, which is why this method works so well! You are adapting your search to the computer's 'language' rather than 
        relying on the computer to adapt to yours. Your computer understands "AND" as the narrowing operator, and "OR" as the broadening operator. This might sound confusing on the surface -- you probably don't think of "and" as meaning "less", and "or" as meaning "more", but you are familar with this idea. Rarely does
        a child make it through grade-school unscathed by at least one Venn Diagram -- these work the same way. If we have 2 circles the "AND" would be the overlapping 
        section, which is the smallest (usually), while "OR" would include both of the side sections. If you struggle to visualize Venn Diagrams, you can just trust me
        and remember that or = more. ("NOT" is the negating operator, which I take to be intuitive).

        <p id="txt" style="display: flex"><img src=".\Boole.jpg" alt="George Boole portrait">
         Boolean search terms are based on Boolean algebra(s), which deal with the values of 0 & 1,
numbers which might look familiar but are conceptually different than what we learn about in 
school. In Boolean algebra 0 and 1 are both assigned truth values, with one being true and 
zero being false. If you are familiar with the system of binary code, you can
likely see Boolean Algebra's influence on its development. 
          <br>
          <br>
         Boolean
algebra had influence over all fields of symbolic and mathematical logic but one interesting field that grew out of 
Boolean logic
is called Propositional Calculus, which applies many of these ideas you are familar with to interpersonal arguments and communication.
While not directly related to research, familiarity with these concepts provides insight into more than just communication with computers!

        Marcia Bates is a Professor of information studies at UCLA, and one of her most famous contributions to the field of Library & Information Science has been her
        "berry picking" model of information seeking/searching. The basic idea is that a researcher will browse and pick "berries" (Information) until their "basket"
        is sufficently full. This model acknowleges that the research process is anything but linear. She differentiated between search "strategies" and search "tactics," with search 
        tactics being little tweaks/steps you make along the way while furthering your research. She described 29 of these tactics seperated between 4 categories. I will list them here. If
        any sound intresting to you I highly encourage looking into them further -- a link to her paper can be found under "Helpful Resources."

        If you're struggling to develop a research question, you can start by thinking of topics you are already interested in or curious about. If your research is for a class,
        naturally you will have to brainstorm within the confines of the rubric, but still try to start with a topic that interests you. Once you've listed your potential topics,
        you can do a preliminary search to get an idea of the kinds (and amount) of prior research there is on your potential topics. You want to choose a topic that people have written about,
        but balance that with consideration of the scope of your chosen topic -- if it's too broad then your results will be clogged with unhelpful information. If it's too narrow then you might struggle
        to get enough information later on (so don't choose the one with the most results just because the number is bigger). Once you have weighed all the pros/cons of your 
        topic, write down what makes it interesting to you, what you already know about it, and what you don't know, but would like to. Thinking about these things along with question words like
        Why, How, Should, Could, etc. can help you generate some good questions. Try to make sure your questions really probe into your topic in some way by making sure they can't just
        be answered with a simple yes or no.
        <br>
        <br>
        It can be useful to do a quick review of your topic in a general source (like an encyclopedia) to find subject-specific search terms. This is especially helpful 
        for the "specify" search tactic ("Search Tactics").
        <br>
        <br>
        You can search several databases at once on one platform, which can be very helpful as long as you understand how it can restict your advanced searching options.
        <br>
        <br>
        One principle you can take from your incredible knowlege of research & apply to web searching is to modify your query to account for how the computer looks for information. You 
        can do this by using words a website would probably use. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Look for "Scope Notes" in controlled vocabularies, these are notes attached to terms that give some guidence on how to use them.
        <br>
        <br>
        When you're doing your first few searches some limiters/filters for high-quality evidence like systemic reviews.
        <br>
        <br>
        Look online for research, subject, or 'lib' guides relating to your topic.
        <br>
        <br>
        Specialized databases are amazing, but don't forget about interdisciplinary databases.
